               serious health hazard that affects millions of people worldwide.
               Exposure to secondhand smoke has been linked to a range of
               negative health outcomes, including lung cancer, heart disease,
               and respiratory problems. In fact, the World Health Organization
               estimates that secondhand smoke causes more than 600,000
               premature deaths each year. It's important for individuals and
               governments to take steps to reduce exposure to secondhand smoke
               in order to protect public health. The Inhalation of secondhand
               smoke by active smokers and their companions is associated with
               illness and death. Many young people around the world are
               exposed to secondhand smoke. Infants and young children
               worldwide are at increased risk of exposure to secondhand smoke
               before and after birth due to their underdeveloped brain, immune
               and respiratory systems. Prenatal and postnatal exposure to
               tobacco smoke is associated with impairment of executive
               function in children and contributes to current and future
               public health burdens. This review examines scientific advances
               in the relationship between secondhand smoke and the development
               of attention-deficit and hyperactive behavior in children, both
               as a symptom and as part of a mental health problem. Tobacco
               smoke inhalation has many effects that are best described in
               terms of changes in regulatory processes, including cell
               communication, structural development, and epigenetic effects
               that are passed from generation to generation. It was decided
               that public health efforts should aim to increase parental
               awareness and compliance with existing guidelines that do not
               recommend safe exposure levels.",

abstract = {Background
Prenatal exposure to active or passive maternal smoking –also referred to as second hand smoke (SHS) exposure – are associated with externalizing behaviors, hyperactivity and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, problems which derive in part from altered self-regulation.
Objectives
Determine the influence of prenatal SHS on infant self-regulation using direct measures of infant behavior in 99 mothers from the Fair Start birth cohort followed at the Columbia Center for Children's Environmental Health.
Methods
Self-regulation was operationalized with self-contingency, the likelihood of maintaining/changing behavior from second-to-second, measured via split-screen video recordings of mothers playing with their 4-month infants. Mother and infant facial and vocal affect, gaze-on/-off partner, and mother touch were coded on a 1 s time-base. Third trimester prenatal SHS was assessed via self-report of a smoker in the home. Weighted-lag time-series models tested conditional effects of SHS-exposure (vs. non-exposure) on infant self-contingency for eight modality-pairings (e.g., mother gaze-infant gaze). Individual-seconds time-series models and analysis of predicted values at t0 interrogated significant weighted-lag findings. Because prior findings link developmental risk factors with lowered self-contingency, we hypothesized that prenatal SHSSHS would predict lowered infant self-contingency.
Results
Relative to non-exposed infants, those who were prenatally exposed to SHS had lower self-contingency (more variable behavior) in all eight models. Follow-up analyses showed that, given infants were likely to be in the most negative facial or vocal affect, those with prenatal SHS were more likely to make larger behavioral changes, moving into less negative or more positive affect and to alternate between gaze-on and off mother. Mothers who were exposed to SHS during pregnancy (vs. non-exposed) showed a similar, albeit less prevalent, pattern of larger changes out of negative facial affect.
Conclusion
These findings extend prior work linking prenatal SHS with youth dysregulated behavior, showing similar effects in infancy, a critically important period that sthe stage for future child development.}

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: There is a substantial body of evidence supporting
               the association between maternal active smoking during pregnancy
               and child development, but the association between prenatal
               exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) and early child
               development has not been well documented. This cross-sectional
               study examines the association between prenatal exposure to ETS
               and the development of children in their first two years of
               life. METHODS: We interviewed the primary caregivers of 446
               children under two years old in rural Guizhou Province, China.
               Based on self-reported assessments about whether the mother was
               exposed to ETS during pregnancy, we divided the children into
               the ETS-exposed group or the non-exposed group. Sociodemographic
               information was collected through a questionnaire. The
               cognitive, language, motor, and socioemotional abilities of
               children were assessed using the Bayley Scales of Infant
               Development III (BSID-III). A multivariate linear regression
               model adjusting for confounding variables was used to estimate
               the association of interest. RESULTS: About 60\% of mothers
               experienced ETS exposure during pregnancy. Cognitive and
               language scores were lower among children in the ETS-exposed
               group. When adjusting for characteristics of the child, the
               mother, the household, and village fixed effects, prenatal
               exposure to ETS was associated with lower cognition scores
               (-3.41; 95\% confidence interval (CI): -6.39 to -0.42; p = 0.03)
               and language scores (-3.01; 95\% CI: -5.39 to -0.09; p = 0.04).
               Frequency of prenatal exposure to ETS was also negatively
               associated with language development (-0.48; 95\% CI: -0.87 to
               -0.09; p = 0.02) before children reached two years old.
               CONCLUSIONS: Prenatal exposure to ETS is negatively associated
               with the cognitive and language development of rural young
               children within their first two years of life. The government
               should take action to raise public awareness about the negative
               effects of tobacco use, with an emphasis on the protection of
               pregnant women and their children, in order to carry through
               comprehensive smoke-free laws in rural areas, while also
               increasing tobacco taxation.",
