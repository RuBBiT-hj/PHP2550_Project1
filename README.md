## Title

Impacts of Smoking During Pregnancy and Enviromental Tobacco Smoke on Self-regulation and Substance Use in Teenagers


## Description

The data set is a survey study with 49 pairs of children and their mothers at birth. The main interest of thisstudy is to examine how smoking during pregnancy (SDP) and environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) exposurewill affect self-regulation, externalizing behavior, and substance use on children. This study is based on aprevious study that recorded the smoking exposure from pregnancy to 6 months postpartum, and these 49pairs of children and mothers are randomly and recruited to the current study. In addition to the previousrecords, this data set contains demographic information of mothers and children, their substance use habits,and the evaluations of their self-regulation, externalizing behavior, and parental knowledge. Also, the surveyasks mothers to reflect whether the children were exposed to smoking from 0 to 6 months until 5 yearspostpartum.
